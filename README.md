Hi! I'm Sumire - IT student specializing in Mobile and Web App Development.

Right now, I’m focusing on:

🌐 Building my personal portfolio website using GitHub Pages – a space to showcase my projects, resume, and contact info. 
💻 Documenting and publishing my school + personal projects like my ATM GUI, OOP mini-projects, and cybersecurity labs. 
🤝 Learning to contribute to open source and eventually start or join collaborative projects to improve my Git and GitHub skills (branches, pull requests, clean commits, and all that good stuff!).

## 💼 Projects I'm Working On
- **ATM GUI System** – Java-based GUI simulation of an ATM
- **Cybersecurity Lab Exercises** – Network scanning, firewalls, and threat analysis
- **OOP Mini Projects** – Java-based hands-on apps using interfaces & inheritance
